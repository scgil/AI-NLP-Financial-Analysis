Current_Ratio_RalphLauren,2.66,1.87,"The company's Current ratio decreased from 2.66 in 2021 to 1.87 in 2022, reflecting a substantial decline in its liquidity. In 2021, the Current ratio was greater than 2.00, suggesting an excess of liquidity. This implied that the company had more than enough current assets to cover its short-term liabilities. While this heightened liquidity provides a robust financial position, it is essential to strategically allocate these surplus resources by considering other alternatives such as making investments or reducing debt. However, in 2022, the Current ratio is in the 1.50 to 2.00 range, indicating that the company had a balanced margin to cover its short-term obligations with its current asset and it was well-prepared to handle unforeseen events affecting liquidity."
Quick_Ratio_RalphLauren,2.07,1.36,"The company's Quick ratio decreased from 2.07 in 2021 to 1.36 in 2022, reflecting a notable decline in its liquidity. In 2021, the Quick ratio was greater than 1.50, suggesting that the company had a surplus of liquid assets beyond the adequate levels needed to cover short-term liabilities. This surplus revealed a potential for the company to allocate resources for other purposes, such as investments or debt reduction. However, in 2022, the Quick ratio fell into the range of 1.00 to 1.50, indicating that the company had a correct proportion of liquid assets to cover short-term obligations. The specified range suggests that its current assets, including cash, marketable securities and accounts receivable, are sufficient to cover its short-term liabilities."
Cash_Ratio_RalphLauren,1.63,0.83,"The company's Cash ratio has decreased from 1.63 in 2021 to 0.83 in 2022, indicating a potential reduction in liquidity. Anyway, both ratios are above 0.40, revealing an excess of liquidity and management should be cautious about maintaining such high levels. Consideration of alternative uses for the surplus cash, such as strategic investments or debt reduction, is advisable to ensure efficient deployment of resources and mitigate the risks associated with an excessively elevated cash position."
