Current_Ratio_Pfizer,1.4,1.22,"The company's Current ratio decreased from 1.40 in 2021 to 1.22 in 2022.

Both ratios fall within the range of 1.00 to 1.50, indicating that the company maintains a sufficient buffer of liquid assets, such as cash, marketable securities and accounts receivable, to cover its short-term liabilities."
Cash_Ratio_Pfizer,0.05,0.01,"The company's Cash ratio decreased from 0.05 in 2021 to 0.01 in 2022.
