Current_Ratio_3M,1.7,1.54,"In 2021, the ratio is at ideal values, as the company would be able to meet current liabilities with its current assets and, in addition, short-term assets represent 150% to 200% of the value of short-term liabilities. Thus, the company is also in a position to meet future contingencies. In 2022, the ratio remains at adequate levels. However, its liquidity has seen a slight decrease compared to 2021."
Quick_Ratio_3M,1.08,0.93,"It suggests that the company had a relatively healthy liquidity position in 2021. It implies that the company had sufficient liquid assets (such as cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable, excluding inventory) to cover its short-term liabilities. In 2022 indicates that the liquidity position has weakened compared to the previous year. The quick ratio falling below 1.00 suggests that the company may have difficulty meeting its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. It implies that the current assets, excluding inventory or other less liquid assets such Prepaid Expenses, may be insufficient to cover the current liabilities. The company might need to rely more on the sale of inventory or other sources to meet its immediate financial obligations."
Cash_Ratio_3M,0.51,0.38,"The ratio for 2021 surpasses the upper limit, as cash constitutes more than 40% of current liabilities. This implies that the company may have an excess of cash on hand, surpassing what is required to meet its short-term obligations. In this context, there could be opportunities for the company to deploy the surplus cash more efficiently. However, it is worth noting that the ratio value for 2022 decreased and fell in the range between 0.20 and 0.40, coming into alignment with optimal cash levels."
