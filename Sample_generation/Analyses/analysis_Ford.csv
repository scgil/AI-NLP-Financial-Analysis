Current_Ratio_Ford,1.2,1.2,"Current ratio, ranging between 1.00 and 1.49 for both 2021 and 2022, indicates that its current assets are likely sufficient to cover short-term debts, but caution is warranted as it may not be well-prepared for unforeseen events. It is important to highlight that the ratio has remained constant in both years at a value of 1.20."
Quick_Ratio_Ford,1.07,1.06,"The Quick ratios for both 2021 and 2022 comfortably reside within the optimal range of 1.00 to 1.50, signaling the company's robust ability to meet short-term liabilities. Quick ratio values reveal a good buffer in the form of readily convertible assets like cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. This ensures the company's capability to fulfill immediate financial obligations without over-reliance on inventory liquidation or other less liquid current assets. However, the ratio has decreased minimally, going from a value of 1.07 in 2021 to 1.06 in 2022."
Cash_Ratio_Ford,0.23,0.26,"The company exhibited a reasonable liquidity position in both 2021 and 2022, with Cash ratios falling within the range of 0.20 to 0.40, indicating that the company had a sufficient amount of cash to cover a significant portion of its short-term liabilities, allowing it to meet immediate financial obligations without major challenges. The slight increase in the Cash ratio from 2021 to 2022 suggests a modest improvement in liquidity."
