Current_Ratio_PayPal,1.22,1.28,"The company's Current ratio increased from 1.22 in 2021 to 1.28 in 2022. With the ratio falling within the range of 1.00 to 1.49 for both years, it indicates that the company's current assets, including cash, accounts receivable and inventory, are generally sufficient to cover its short-term liabilities. However, it may still be a need for careful management of liquidity to handle unexpected events."

Both ratios fall within the range of 1.00 to 1.50, indicating that the company maintains a sufficient buffer of liquid assets, such as cash, marketable securities and accounts receivable, to cover its short-term liabilities."
Cash_Ratio_PayPal,0.12,0.17,"The company's Cash ratio increased from 0.12 in 2021 to 0.17 in 2022.
