Both ratio values are below 1.00, signifying that current liabilities exceed current assets, suggesting potential difficulties in meeting short-term obligations. And the decreasing trend raises concerns about the company's ability to address liquidity challenges."

This sustained low Quick ratio suggests ongoing difficulty in fulfilling immediate financial responsibilities without relying significantly on inventory or other less liquid current assets."
