Current_Ratio_Nike,2.72,2.63,"The company's current ratio decreased slightly from 2.72 in 2021 to 2.63 in 2022, both of which fall within the range greater than 2.00. A current ratio above 2.00 indicates that the company has ample current assets to cover its current liabilities, suggesting an excess of liquidity. Surplus resources could be used for other purposes, such as making investments or reducing debt."

This surplus liquidity could be managed more efficiently by considering strategic alternatives such as making investments or reducing debt."
Cash_Ratio_Nike,1.02,0.8,"The company's Cash ratio has decreased from 1.02 in 2021 to 0.80 in 2022, indicating a potential reduction in liquidity. Although both ratios are above 0.40, revealing an excess of liquidity, management should be cautious about maintaining such high levels. Consideration of alternative uses for the surplus cash, such as strategic investments or debt reduction, is advisable to ensure efficient deployment of resources and mitigate the risks associated with an excessively elevated cash position."
