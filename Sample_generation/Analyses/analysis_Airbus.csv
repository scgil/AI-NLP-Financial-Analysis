Current_Ratio_Airbus,1.33,1.22,"In 2021, the company possesses ample current assets to meet short-term debts, but there is a potential lack of readiness for unexpected events impacting liquidity. In 2022, the situation remains similar, but it is noteworthy that the ratio slightly decreases in value."
Quick_Ratio_Airbus,0.36,0.35,"The company had substantial difficulty meeting its short-term obligations using its most liquid assets in 2021. In 2022, the company continues to face challenges in meeting short-term obligations with its most liquid assets and the situation is even worse because Quick ratio has slightly decreased."
Cash_Ratio_Airbus,0.1,0.16,"The company's cash ratio has increased from 0.10 in 2021 to 0.16 in 2022, indicating a positive trend. However, both ratios fall below the recommended range of 0.20 to 0.40. In 2021, the low cash ratio of 0.10 suggests a potential difficulty in meeting immediate financial obligations, signaling a liquidity risk. The increase to 0.16 in 2022 is an improvement, moving closer to the acceptable range, but the company still lacks a reasonable amount of cash to comfortably cover its short-term liabilities."
