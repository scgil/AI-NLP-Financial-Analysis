Current_Ratio_Apple,1.07,0.88,"In 2021 the company would be able to meet current liabilities with its current assets. However, it is desirable that liquid assets exceed short-term liabilities by 50% in order to cope with possible unforeseen events. In 2022 the company reduces the value of the ratio and falls below 1, which means that the company may have difficulty meeting its short-term liabilities."
Quick_Ratio_Apple,1.02,0.85,"In 2021, the company had just enough liquid assets to cover its short-term obligations. The Quick ratio being right around 1.00 indicates that current assets, excluding inventory and other less liquid assets, were approximately equal to its short-term liabilities. While it met its immediate financial obligations, there was not a significant buffer of liquid assets. In 2022, Quick ratio has decreased and indicates a deterioration in the liquidity position. The quick ratio falling below 1.00 suggests that the company faced increased difficulty in meeting its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets."
Cash_Ratio_Apple,0.28,0.15,"In 2021, the company demonstrated an adequate cash to current liabilities ratio, as cash is between 20% and 40% of short-term liabilities. However, in 2022, Cash ratio decreased and fell below 0.20, indicating that cash on hand is insufficient to cover 20% of current liabilities."
