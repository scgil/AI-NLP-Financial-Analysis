Current_Ratio_ResMed,1.73,2.8,"The company's Current ratio increased from 1.73 in 2021 to 2.80 in 2022, reflecting a substantial improvement in its liquidity. In 2021, the Current ratio was in the 1.50 to 2.00 range, suggesting that the company had a balanced margin to cover its short-term obligations with its current asset and it was well-prepared to handle unforeseen events affecting liquidity. However, in 2022, the Current ratio was above 2.00, indicating an excess of liquidity. This implied that the company had more than enough current assets to cover its short-term liabilities. While this heightened liquidity provides a robust financial position, it is essential to strategically allocate these surplus resources by considering other alternatives such as making investments or reducing debt."

Both ratios fall within the range of 1.00 to 1.50, indicating that the company maintains a sufficient buffer of liquid assets, such as cash, marketable securities and accounts receivable, to cover its short-term liabilities."

This suggests that the company is likely to meet its immediate financial obligations without significant challenges."
