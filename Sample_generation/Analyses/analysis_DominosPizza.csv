Current_Ratio_DominosPizza,1.85,1.46,"In 2021, the company's Current ratio is comfortably above 1.50. It suggests that the company has a strong liquidity position. Its current assets are significantly higher than its short-term liabilities, indicating a healthy ability to cover immediate obligations. This provides a good buffer for unforeseen events affecting liquidity. In 2022, company's Current ratio decreased and fell into the range between 1.00 and 1.49. The decrease indicates a reduction in the company's liquidity buffer compared to the previous year but still enought to meet its short-term obligations. However, the company is less prepared to face unforeseen events affecting liquidity. It's important to investigate the reasons behind the decline."
Quick_Ratio_DominosPizza,1.65,1.29,"In 2021, Quick ratio would suggest that the company might have had an excessive surplus of easily convertible assets relative to its short-term liabilities. This could imply that resources were not optimally utilized for other purposes, potentially affecting the efficiency of the company's operations. The Quick ratio decrease in 2022, falling into the range between 1.00 and 1.50, may be viewed as a positive adjustment, correcting the excess of liquidity of 2021 and bringing the ratio to a more balanced level. In 2022, the company has a correct level of liquid assets to cover its short-term liabilities."
Cash_Ratio_DominosPizza,0.36,0.25,"The company maintained a relatively healthy Cash ratio in both years, indicating a reasonable ability to cover short-term obligations. With a ratio between 0.20 and 0.40 in 2021 and in 2022, the company had a reasonable amount of cash to cover a significant portion of its short-term liabilities. This suggests that the organization was likely able to meet its immediate financial obligations without significant challenges. The slight decrease in the cash ratio in 2022 suggests a marginal reduction in the company's ability to cover short-term liabilities with available cash."
