Current_Ratio_Macdonals,1.78,1.43,"While the company's Current ratio was initially optimal in 2021, it decreased to a level below the ideal range of 1.50 to 2.00 in 2022. Despite both ratios still suggesting an ability to cover short-term debts, the 2022 Current ratio value indicates a reduced preparedness to handle unforeseen events affecting liquidity."
Quick_Ratio_Macdonals,1.64,1.24,"The company's Quick ratio decrease from 2021 to 2022, moving from a value over 1.50 which indicates an excess of liquidity to a more balanced range (between 1.00 and 1.50). This suggests a correction in its short-term liquidity position. This adjustment may reflect a more efficient allocation of resources, emphasizing the company's ability to meet immediate financial obligations while potentially optimizing the use of its most liquid assets, excluding less liquid items like inventory or prepaid expenses."
Cash_Ratio_Macdonals,1.17,0.68,"Despite the Cash ratio is over 0.40 in both years, which indicates an excess of liquidity, the company experienced a decline in its Cash ratio from 2021 to 2022. This suggests potential opportunities for optimizing cash utilization and prompting a careful assessment of its financial strategy to strike a balance between maintaining robust liquidity and effectively deploying resources."
