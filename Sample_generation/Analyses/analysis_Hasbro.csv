Current_Ratio_Hasbro,1.52,1.37,"In 2021, company has a comfortable cushion to cover its short-term liabilities. However, the decreased Current ratio in 2022 places the company on the range between 1.00 and 1.49. This indicates a potential reduction in its ability to cover short-term debts. In 2022, the company could still face its short-term liabilities using its current assets but might be not be well-prepared for unforeseen events affecting its liquidity."
Quick_Ratio_Hasbro,1.03,0.75,"The company exhibited a favorable Quick ratio in 2021, signaling a robust ability to cover short-term liabilities with its most liquid assets. However, there was a notable decline in the Quick ratio in 2022. The Quick ratio below 1.00 in 2022 indicates that the company's readily available liquid assets, including cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable, are insufficient to cover its short-term liabilities."
Cash_Ratio_Hasbro,0.42,0.23,"Cash ratio in 2021 is above 0.40, indicating that the company had a higher level of cash relative to its short-term liabilities. This could imply an inefficient use of cash, as excessively high cash ratios may suggest that the company is not effectively deploying its resources. In 2022, Cash ratio decreased and fell in the range between 0.20 and 0.40, which is considerated the ideal cash to current liabilities relationship."
