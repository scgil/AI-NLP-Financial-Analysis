Current_Ratio_Hilton,0.95,0.85,"Company is consistently operating with a Current ratio below 1.00 in both years. These ratios indicate that the company's current liabilities exceed its current assets, which suggests potential difficulties in meeting short-term obligations. The decrease from 2021 to 2022 indicates a further decline in the liquidity position."
Quick_Ratio_Hilton,0.92,0.82,"While a Quick ratio between 1.00 and 1.50 is generally considered healthy, both ratios are below 1.00, suggesting that the company may face difficulty in meeting immediate financial obligations without relying on the inventory or other less liquid current assets. The decline from 2021 to 2022 raises concerns about the company's liquidity position, as it indicates a reduction in the buffer of readily convertible assets like cash, marketable securities and accounts receivable."
Cash_Ratio_Hilton,0.47,0.36,"Cash ratio in 2021 suggests that the company had a higher level of cash relative to its short-term liabilities. This may indicate an inefficient use of cash, as excessively high cash ratios might imply that the company is not optimizing its resources. In 2022, the subsequent decrease and fall of the Cash ratio into the range between 0.20 and 0.40 signifies a potential adjustment in the company's approach to cash management, successfully mitigating the excess of cash experienced in the previous year."
