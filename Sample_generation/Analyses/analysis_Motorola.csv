Despite this decrease, the ratios for both years indicate the company's continued ability to cover short-term debts using its current assets. Nevertheless, it may not be well-prepared against unforeseen events affecting its liquidity."
Quick_Ratio_Motorola,1.14,0.92,"In 2021, the Quick ratio ranging between 1.00 and 1.50 suggests that the company has sufficient liquid assets to meet immediate financial obligations without relying on less liquid assets. The observed decline in 2022 raises concerns about the company's liquidity. The company's decrease in the Quick ratio from 2021 to 2022 indicates a potential challenge in covering short-term obligations with its most liquid assets, as the ratio value fall below 1.00. It highlights the importance of addressing this decrease to maintain financial resilience and meet short-term liabilities effectively."
