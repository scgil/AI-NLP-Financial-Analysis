Current_Ratio_HP,0.91,0.88,"A Current ratio below 1.00 in both years indicates current liabilities exceed its current assets, suggesting a potential liquidity challenge in meeting short-term obligations. The decrease from 2021 to 2022 implies a slight worsening of the liquidity position."
Quick_Ratio_HP,0.69,0.66,"The company's Quick ratio in both years indicates a consistent challenge in meeting short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. With both ratios below 1.00, the company's readily available liquid assets, such as cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable, are insufficient to cover its short-term liabilities. The slight decrease from 2021 to 2022 suggests a potential tightening of the company's liquidity position."
Cash_Ratio_HP,0.19,0.18,"The company's Cash ratios in both years, 2021 and 2022, fall below the 0.20 threshold. A Cash ratio below 0.20 indicates that the available cash may not be enough to cover a significant portion of short-term liabilities. This suggests potential challenges in meeting immediate financial obligations. The slight decrease in the cash ratio from 2021 to 2022 could indicate a continued strain on liquidity."
