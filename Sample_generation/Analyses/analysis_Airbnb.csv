Current_Ratio_Airbnb,1.95,1.86,"In both 2021 and 2022, the ratio remains within the ideal range, with short-term assets and receivables surpassing short-term obligations by 50% to 100%.

While the ratio for both years falls within the same range, it is important to note that the ratio has decreased in 2022 compared to 2021, indicating that liquidity has been reduced."

Anyway, the ratio has decreased in 2022 compared to 2021."
