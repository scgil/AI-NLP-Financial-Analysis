Current_Ratio_GeneralMotors,1.1,1.1,"Current ratio, ranging between 1.00 and 1.49 for both 2021 and 2022, indicates that company's current assets can cover its short-term debts, but caution is warranted as it may not be well-prepared for unforeseen events. It is important to highlight that the ratio has remained constant at a value of 1.10 in both years."
Quick_Ratio_GeneralMotors,0.93,0.93,"Quick ratio in both 2021 and 2022 indicates that the company is consistently facing difficulty in meeting its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. The Quick ratio below 1.00 indicates that the company's readily available liquid assets, including cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable, are insufficient to cover its short-term liabilities. While the stability of the Quick ratio, at a value of 0.93, suggests a consistent liquidity position over the two years, it also raises concerns about the company's ability to meet immediate financial obligations without relying on inventory or other less liquid current assets."
Cash_Ratio_GeneralMotors,0.27,0.21,"In 2021, Cash ratio falls within the range of 0.20 to 0.40, suggesting a healthy liquidity position and the ability to cover a significant portion of short-term liabilities. However, the decrease in the Cash ratio in 2022, while still within the same range, indicates a reduction in the company's liquidity."
