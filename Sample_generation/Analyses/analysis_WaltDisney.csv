Current_Ratio_WaltDisney,1.08,1.0,"The company's Current ratio decreased from 1.08 in 2021 to 1.00 in 2022, indicating a reduction in its liquidity. Both ratios fall within the range of 1.00 to 1.49, suggesting that the company's current assets, including cash, accounts receivable and inventory, are generally sufficient to cover its short-term liabilities. However, it may still be a need for careful management of liquidity to handle unexpected events."
Quick_Ratio_WaltDisney,1.04,0.94,"The company's Quick ratio declined from 1.04 in 2021 to 0.94 in 2022, indicating a reduction in its liquidity. In 2021, the Quick ratio fell within the range of 1.00 to 1.50, indicating that the company had a sufficient buffer of liquid assets (such as cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable) to cover its short-term liabilities. In 2022, a Quick ratio below 1.00 raises concerns about the company's ability to cover current liabilities without relying on inventory or other less liquid assets."
Cash_Ratio_WaltDisney,0.51,0.4,"The company's Cash ratio decreased from 0.51 in 2021 to 0.40 in 2022, reflecting a reduction in its liquidity. In 2021, the Cash ratio was above 0.40, suggesting an excess of liquidity. This implied that the company had more cash on hand than needed for its short-term liabilities. In 2022, the Cash ratio is in the range between 0.20 and 0.40, indicating a balanced liquidity position. The specified range suggests that the company has a reasonable amount of cash to cover a significant portion of its short-term liabilities and the company is likely to meet its immediate financial obligations without significant challenges."
