Current_Ratio_Starbucks,1.2,0.77,"The company's Current ratio decreased from 1.20 in 2021 to 0.77 in 2022, reflecting a reduction in its liquidity. In 2021, the Current ratio was in the 1.00 to 1.49 range, suggesting that the company's current assets, including cash, accounts receivable and inventory, are generally sufficient to cover its short-term liabilities. However, it may still be a need for careful management of liquidity to handle unexpected events. In 2022, the Current ratio was below 1.00, indicating that the company's current liabilities surpass its current assets. This implies a potential challenge in meeting short-term debts, signaling liquidity issues."

Both Quick ratios fall below the threshold of 1.00, indicating a challenge in meeting short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. Its current assets, including cash, marketable securities and accounts receivable, are insufficient to cover its short-term liabilities."

In 2021, the Cash ratio was above 0.40, suggesting an excess of liquidity. This implied that the company had more cash on hand than needed for its short-term liabilities.

The specified range suggests that the company has a reasonable amount of cash to cover a significant portion of its short-term liabilities and the company is likely to meet its immediate financial obligations without significant challenges."
