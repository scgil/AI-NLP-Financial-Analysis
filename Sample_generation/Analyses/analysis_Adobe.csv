Current_Ratio_Adobe,1.25,1.11,"Current ratio, ranging between 1.00 and 1.49 for both 2021 and 2022, indicates that its current assets are likely sufficient to cover short-term debts, but caution is warranted as it may not be well-prepared for unforeseen events affecting liquidity. Although the ratio for both years falls within the same range, it is important to note that the ratio has decreased in 2022 compared to 2021, indicating that liquidity has been reduced."
Quick_Ratio_Adobe,1.11,1.0,"The company had a healthy liquidity position in 2021. This implies that the company had sufficient liquid assets, such as cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable (excluding inventory or other less liquid assets such prepaid expenses), to cover its short-term liabilities. In 2022 ratio suggests that the liquidity position has weakened compared to the previous year. While the quick ratio is still between 1.00 and 1.50, the decrease raises concerns about the ability to cover short-term liabilities with the most liquid assets."
Cash_Ratio_Adobe,0.55,0.52,"Both in 2021 and 2022, cash exceeds appropriate levels, so short-term resources are not being used adequately. Although the ratio has slightly decreased in 2022, the excess of liquidity persists."
