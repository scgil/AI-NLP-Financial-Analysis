Current_Ratio_Lowes,1.19,1.02,"The company experienced a decline in its Current ratio from 2021 to 2022, signaling a potential reduction in liquidity. However, both ratios fall within the range between 1.00 and 1.49, indicating that the company is able to cover short-term debts using its current assets but may not be well-prepared to handle unforeseen events."
Quick_Ratio_Lowes,0.33,0.12,"Exhibiting a notable decrease from the previous year, the company's Quick ratio in 2022 reinforces a concerning trend. As both ratios fall below the crucial threshold of 1.00, it indicates a consistent struggle to meet short-term obligations with its most liquid assets and underscores a heightened risk in fulfilling immediate financial responsibilities without substantial reliance on inventory or other less liquid assets."
Cash_Ratio_Lowes,0.25,0.06,"The company experienced a significant decrease in its Cash ratio from 2021 to 2022, transitioning from a value within the range of 0.20 to 0.40 to a value below 0.20. While the Quick ratio value in 2021, at 0.25, is indicative of a reasonable ability to cover short-term liabilities, the Cash ratio value in 2022 suggests a potential difficulty in meeting immediate financial obligations."
