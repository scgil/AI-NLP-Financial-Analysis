Current_Ratio_Fedex,1.51,1.43,"The company's Current ratio in 2021 is comfortably above 1.50. Its current assets are significantly higher than its short-term liabilities, indicating a healthy ability to cover immediate obligations. This provides a good buffer for unforeseen events affecting liquidity. In 2022, the company's Current ratio decreased and fell within the range between 1.00 and 1.49. Although the company is still able to meet its current liabilities using its current assets, it might not be well-prepared to handle unexpected events affecting liquidity."
Quick_Ratio_Fedex,1.45,1.36,"Both the 2021 and 2022 Quick ratios are a positive indicator. It suggests that the company had a comfortable liquidity position, with more than enough liquid assets to cover its short-term obligations. The Quick ratio decreased in 2022, but still between 1.00 and 1.50, indicating that the company had a surplus of easily convertible assets, such as cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable (excluding inventory and other less liquid assets), providing a balanced buffer to meet immediate financial obligations without relying heavily on the sale of inventory or other less liquid resources."
Cash_Ratio_Fedex,0.52,0.48,"Cash ratios for 2021 and 2022 are upper 0.40, so the company had more than a reasonable amount of cash to cover a significant portion of its short-term liabilities, which indicates an excess of liquidity. In 2022, Cash ratio decreased but still upper 0.40. And while having ample cash is generally positive for liquidity, excessively high Cash ratios might indicate that the company is not effectively utilizing its resources."
