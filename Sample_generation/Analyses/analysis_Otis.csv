Current_Ratio_Otis,1.32,0.9,"In 2021, the company had a Current ratio of 1.32, indicating that current assets were sufficient to cover short-term debts, though there were concerns about preparedness for unforeseen events affecting liquidity. However, in 2022, the ratio decreased to 0.90, falling below 1.00 and suggesting that current liabilities now exceed current assets, potentially posing challenges in meeting immediate financial obligations. The company should address these liquidity issues promptly, considering strategies to improving its financial position and enhance resilience in the face of unexpected financial needs."
Quick_Ratio_Otis,1.22,0.81,"The company's Quick ratio declined from 1.22 in 2021 to 0.81 in 2022. In 2021, the quick ratio fell within the range of 1.00 to 1.50, indicating that the company had a sufficient buffer of liquid assets (such as cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable) to cover its short-term liabilities. In 2022, a Quick ratio below 1.00 raises concerns about the company's ability to cover current liabilities without relying on inventory or other less liquid assets such as prepaid expenses."
Cash_Ratio_Otis,0.25,0.17,"In 2021, the company's Cash ratio of 0.25 fell within the range of 0.20 to 0.40, indicating a reasonably healthy liquidity position. This suggested the company had a sufficient amount of cash to cover a significant portion of its short-term liabilities and the organization is likely to meet its immediate financial obligations without significant challenges. However, in 2022, the cash ratio decreased to 0.17, dropping below the 0.20 threshold. A Cash ratio below 0.20 indicates a low level of liquidity and the company may face challenges in paying off its short-term debts."
