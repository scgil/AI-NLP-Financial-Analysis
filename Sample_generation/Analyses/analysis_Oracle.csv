Current_Ratio_Oracle,2.3,1.62,"The company's Current ratio decreased from 2.30 in 2021 to 1.62 in 2022, indicating a reduction in its liquidity. In 2021, a Current ratio above 2.00 indicates a significant excess of liquidity, suggesting the company has more than enough current assets to cover its short-term liabilities. While this heightened liquidity provides a robust financial position, it's essential to strategically allocate these surplus resources by considering strategic alternatives such as making investments or reducing debt. In contrast, in 2022, Current ratio is into the range between 1.50 and 2.00, suggesting that company's current assets are generally sufficient to cover its short-term liabilities, providing a reasonable buffer for unforeseen events."
Quick_Ratio_Oracle,2.15,1.43,"In 2021, the company's Quick ratio is 2.15, surpassing the threshold of 1.50 and revealing an excess of liquidity. This surplus provided an opportunity for resource reallocation, whether for investments or debt reduction. Moving to 2022, the Quick ratio decreased to 1.43, falling within the ideal range between 1.00 and 1.50. This indicates the company maintains an adequate buffer of easily convertible assets (such as cash, marketable securities and accounts receivable) to meet immediate financial obligations without relying on the sale of inventory or other less liquid assets."
Cash_Ratio_Oracle,1.25,1.1,"The company's Cash ratio has decreased from 1.25 in 2021 to 1.10 in 2022, indicating a potential reduction in liquidity. Anyway, both ratios are above 0.40, revealing an excess of liquidity and management should be cautious about maintaining such high levels. Consideration of alternative uses for the surplus cash, such as strategic investments or debt reduction, is advisable to ensure efficient deployment of resources and mitigate the risks associated with an excessively elevated cash position."
