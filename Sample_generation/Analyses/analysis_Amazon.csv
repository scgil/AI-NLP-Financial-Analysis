Current_Ratio_Amazon,1.14,0.94,"In 2021, current assets (cash, accounts receivable, short-term investments and inventory) are enough to offset short-term debts. Nonetheless, the company might not be adequately prepared for unexpected events impacting its liquidity. In contrast, in 2022, ratio has decreased and is less than 1, signifying that current liabilities surpass current assets. This suggests a deficiency in liquidity, indicating that the company may struggle to meet its short-term debts."
Quick_Ratio_Amazon,0.91,0.72,"The company had some difficulty meeting its short-term obligations using its most liquid assets in both years. In 2022 Quick ratio has decreased, which suggests a further decline in the liquidity position of the company. A Quick ratio below 1.00 implies that most liquid assets were insufficient to cover its short-term liabilities."
Cash_Ratio_Amazon,0.25,0.35,"In both 2021 and 2022, the cash levels constitute an optimal range, making up between 20% and 40% of the current liabilities. However, it is important to note that in 2022 Cash ratio has increased, which means that company liquidity positition is stronger than in 2021."
