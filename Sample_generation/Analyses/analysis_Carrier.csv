Current_Ratio_Carrier,1.72,1.64,"The company had a healthy Current ratio in 2021. Short-term assets were 72% higher than its short-term liabilities. This indicates a good level of liquidity and suggests that the company was well-prepared to meet its short-term obligations. Current ratio slightly decreased in 2022 compared to 2021. Although the Current ratio is still within the ideal range, the decrease suggests a slight reduction in the liquidity buffer of the company."
Quick_Ratio_Carrier,1.42,1.2,"In 2021, the company had sufficient liquid assets to cover its short-term liabilities. The company had an adequate buffer of easily convertible assets, such as cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable, to meet its immediate financial obligations without relying on the sale of inventory. In 2022, the company has experienced a slight decrease in liquidity compared to the previous year. The company may still have enough liquid assets to cover its short-term liabilities, but the decrease in the quick ratio suggests a potential reduction in the buffer of easily convertible assets."
Cash_Ratio_Carrier,0.45,0.58,"In 2021, the company had more than a reasonable amount of cash to cover a significant portion of its short-term liabilities. This suggests that the organization was likely able to meet its immediate financial obligations without significant challenges but a ratio over 0.40 reveals and excess of cash. The increase in the Cash ratio indicates that the company had even more cash relative to its short-term liabilities in 2022 compared to 2021. While having ample cash is generally positive for liquidity, it is important to consider that excessively high cash ratios might indicate that the company is not effectively utilizing its resources."
