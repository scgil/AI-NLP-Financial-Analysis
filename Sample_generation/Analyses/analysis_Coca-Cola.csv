Current_Ratio_Coca-Cola,1.13,1.15,"Current ratio in 2021 is slightly above 1.00. It suggests that current assets are barely sufficient to cover its short-term liabilities. While the company can meet its immediate obligations, there might be a limited buffer for unforeseen events affecting liquidity. This indicates a relatively tight liquidity position. Current ratio increased slightly in 2022, suggesting a slight improvement in the liquidity position of the company. However, the ratio is still just above 1.00, indicating that the company is operating with a relatively thin margin for covering short-term obligations. There may still be a need for careful management of liquidity to handle unexpected events."
Quick_Ratio_Coca-Cola,0.81,0.77,"In 2021, Quick ratio being below 1.00 suggests that current assets, excluding inventory and other less liquid assets, were not quite sufficient to cover its short-term liabilities. It may have faced some challenges in meeting immediate financial obligations without relying on the sale of inventory or other less liquid resources. The decrease in the Quick ratio in 2022 suggests a further tightening of the company's liquidity position."
Cash_Ratio_Coca-Cola,0.49,0.48,"Cash ratio values for 2021 and 2022 are indeed above 0.40. This indicates that the company presents an excess of liquidity. And while having ample cash is positive for liquidity, excessively high Cash ratios might suggest that the company is not effectively utilizing its resources. In 2022, Cash ratio has slightly decreased, but the excess of liquidity persists."
