Current_Ratio_Moderna,1.76,2.73,"The company's Current ratio, initially reflecting a perfect balance between current assets and short-term liabilities in 2021, increased significantly in 2022. A Current ratio above 2.00 in 2022 suggests a substantial excess of liquidity, indicating that current assets are more than double of current liabilities.  This highlights the need for careful financial management to ensure optimal resource utilization."
Quick_Ratio_Moderna,1.52,2.29,"The company's Quick ratio, above 1.50 in both 2021 and 2022, indicates an excess of liquidity. However, the notable increase in the Quick ratio in 2022 suggests a larger surplus of its most liquid assets compared to 2021. While this could imply an enhanced ability to cover short-term obligations, it also raises considerations about the efficient deployment of liquidity resources, emphasizing the need for a balanced approach in managing resources to optimize the company's financial position and strategic initiatives."
Cash_Ratio_Moderna,0.75,0.65,"In this scenario, a Cash ratio exceeding 0.40 in both 2021 and 2022 indicates an excess of liquidity. This also signals a potential imbalance between surplus cash and short-term liabilities, prompting a critical examination of financial strategies to optimize resource allocation and ensure the company efficiently deploys its cash resources."
