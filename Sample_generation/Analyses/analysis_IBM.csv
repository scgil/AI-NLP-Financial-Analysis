Current_Ratio_IBM,0.88,0.92,"In 2021, the company appears to have a liquidity issue, as its current assets are not enough to cover its current liabilities. This may raise concerns about the company's ability to meet its short-term obligations. While the Current ratio has improved from 2021, it is still below 1.00 in 2022. This suggests that the company's liquidity situation has not significantly improved and remains a concern. The company may need to take measures to enhance its liquidity and manage its short-term obligations more effectively."
Quick_Ratio_IBM,0.73,0.79,"In 2021, the Quick ratio suggests difficulty for the company in meeting its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets, as current assets (excluding inventory and less liquid assets, such as prepaid expenses) are insufficient to cover current liabilities. In 2022, although the Quick ratio has improved from the previous year, it is still below 1.00 and the company continues facing difficulty in meeting its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets."
Cash_Ratio_IBM,0.2,0.25,"In 2021, the Cash ratio falls into the range between 0.20 and 0.40, which means that the company has a reasonable amount of cash on hand to cover a significant portion of its short-term liabilities. It suggests that the organization is likely to meet its immediate financial obligations without significant challenges. In 2022, the Cash ratio value is still within the same range, indicating that the company continues to maintain a reasonable amount of cash. The slight increase from 2021 to 2022 suggests a potential improvement in liquidity, as the company has a slightly higher proportion of cash relative to its short-term obligations."
