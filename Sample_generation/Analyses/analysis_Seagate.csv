Current_Ratio_Seagate,1.29,1.13,"The company's Current ratio decreased from 1.29 in 2021 to 1.13 in 2022, indicating a reduction in its liquidity. Both ratios fall within the range of 1.00 to 1.49, suggesting that the company's current assets, including cash, accounts receivable and inventory, are generally sufficient to cover its short-term liabilities. However, it may still be a need for careful management of liquidity to handle unexpected events."
Quick_Ratio_Seagate,0.88,0.69,"The company's Quick ratio declined from 0.88 in 2021 to 0.69 in 2022, suggesting a reduction in its liquidity. Both ratios fall below the threshold of 1.00, indicating a challenge in meeting short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. Its current assets, including cash, marketable securities and accounts receivable, are insufficient to cover its short-term liabilities."
Cash_Ratio_Seagate,0.41,0.17,"The company's Cash ratio decreased from 0.41 in 2021 to 0.17 in 2022, indicating a reduction in its liquidity. In 2021, the Cash ratio was above 0.40, suggesting an excess of liquidity. This implied that the company had more cash on hand than needed for its short-term liabilities. In 2022, the Cash ratio is below the 0.20 threshold, which indicates a low level of liquidity and the company may face challenges in paying off its short-term debts."
