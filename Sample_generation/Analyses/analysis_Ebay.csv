Current_Ratio_Ebay,1.97,2.18,"In 2021, the company had a relatively strong liquidity position, with short-term assets and receivables covering short-term obligations comfortably. In 2022, Current ratio is greater than 2.00, so the company's liquidity position appears to have strengthened further, with current assets being more than double its current liabilities. This situation in 2022 suggests a significant excess of liquidity."
Quick_Ratio_Ebay,1.73,1.93,"In 2021, the company maintained a Quick ratio surpassing 1.50, indicating an excess of current assets, excluding inventories, beyond what was necessary to cover short-term liabilities. This situation persisted in 2022, with the ratio still exceeding 1.50 and having increased from the previous year. This underscores the company's ongoing surplus of easily convertible assets compared to its short-term liabilities, suggesting an opportunity to allocate liquidity resources to other purposes."
Cash_Ratio_Ebay,0.3,0.5,"The company maintained a reasonable level of liquidity in 2021. However, in 2022, the Cash ratio increased, surpassing the upper limit of 0.40 and suggesting a potential excess of cash relative to short-term liabilities. While a higher Cash ratio is generally positive for liquidity, an excessively high ratio may indicate suboptimal resource utilization."
