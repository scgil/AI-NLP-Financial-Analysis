Current_Ratio_Rollins,0.72,0.71,"The company's Current ratio declined from 0.72 in 2021 to 0.71 in 2022. Both ratios fall below the threshold of 1.00, suggesting that the company's current liabilities surpass its current assets.

Quick_Ratio_Rollins,0.66,0.65,"The company's Quick ratio declined from 0.66 in 2021 to 0.65 in 2022. Both ratios fall below the threshold of 1.00, indicating a challenge in meeting short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. Its current assets, including cash, marketable securities and accounts receivable, are insufficient to cover its short-term liabilities."
Cash_Ratio_Rollins,0.21,0.19,"The company's Cash ratio decreased from 0.21 in 2021 to 0.19 in 2022. In 2021, the Cash ratio fall within the range of 0.20 to 0.40, indicating a reasonably healthy liquidity position. This suggested the company had a sufficient amount of cash to cover a significant portion of its short-term liabilities and the organization is likely to meet its immediate financial obligations without significant challenges. In 2022, the Cash ratio is below the 0.20 threshold, which indicates a low level of liquidity and the company may face challenges in paying off its short-term debts."
