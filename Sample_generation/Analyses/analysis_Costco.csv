Current_Ratio_Costco,1.0,1.02,"Current ratio in 2021 suggests that current assets are barely sufficient to cover its short-term liabilities. While the company can meet its immediate obligations, there might be a limited buffer for unforeseen events affecting liquidity. This indicates a relatively tight liquidity position. Current ratio increased slightly in 2022, suggesting a slight improvement in the liquidity position of the company. However, the ratio is still just above 1.00, indicating that the company is operating with a relatively thin margin for covering short-term obligations. There may still be a need for careful management of liquidity to handle unexpected events."
Quick_Ratio_Costco,0.52,0.46,"The Quick ratio values below 1.00 in both 2021 and 2022, indicates that the company's current assets, excluding inventory and other less liquid assets, were insufficient to cover its short-term liabilities. This implies a high reliance on the sale of inventory or other less liquid assets to meet immediate financial obligations. Anyway, in 2022, Quick ratio decreased, indicating a worse liquidity position compared to 2021."
Cash_Ratio_Costco,0.38,0.32,"The company maintained a relatively healthy Cash ratio in both years with a ratio between 0.20 and 0.40, indicating a reasonable ability to cover short-term obligations. The slight decrease in the Cash ratio in 2022 suggests a marginal reduction in the company's ability to cover short-term liabilities with available cash."
