In 2022, the company's Current ratio has decreased from the previous year, addressing the excess of liquidity observed in 2021. The Current ratio in 2022 falls within an optimal range (between 1.50 and 2.00), signifying that short-term assets are well-suited to cover short-term obligations. This maintains a healthy liquidity position, preparing the company well for unforeseen events that may affect its liquidity.   \n",

       "Current_Ratio_NetApp  The company's Current ratio decreased from 1.74 in 2021 to 1.50 in 2022. While both ratios fall within the range considered healthy (between 1.50 and 2.00), the decline suggests a slight reduction in short-term liquidity. The 2022 ratio still indicates that the company's current assets are generally sufficient to cover its short-term liabilities, providing a reasonable buffer for unforeseen events. However, management should closely monitor liquidity trends and take proactive measures if the ratio continues to decrease, ensuring the company maintains a robust financial position in the face of potential challenges.  \n",

However, by 2022, the Quick ratio decreased and fell within the range of 1.00 to 1.50, indicating that the company has corrected the excess of liquidity and still maintains a healthy ability to cover immediate financial obligations with a reduced buffer of easily convertible assets.  \n",

This provides a good buffer for unforeseen events affecting liquidity. In 2022, company's Current ratio decreased and fell into the range between 1.00 and 1.49.

       "33  The company's Current ratio decreased from 2.30 in 2021 to 1.62 in 2022, indicating a reduction in its liquidity. In 2021, a Current ratio above 2.00 indicates a significant excess of liquidity, suggesting the company has more than enough current assets to cover its short-term liabilities. While this heightened liquidity provides a robust financial position, it's essential to strategically allocate these surplus resources by considering strategic alternatives such as making investments or reducing debt. In contrast, in 2022, Current ratio is into the range between 1.50 and 2.00, suggesting that company's current assets are generally sufficient to cover its short-term liabilities, providing a reasonable buffer for unforeseen events.   \n",

However, in 2022, the ratio decreased to 0.90, falling below 1.00 and suggesting that current liabilities now exceed current assets, potentially posing challenges in meeting immediate financial obligations.

       "20    In 2021, the Cash ratio falls into the range between 0.20 and 0.40, which means that the company has a reasonable amount of cash on hand to cover a significant portion of its short-term liabilities. It suggests that the organization is likely to meet its immediate financial obligations without significant challenges. In 2022, the Cash ratio value is still within the same range, indicating that the company continues to maintain a reasonable amount of cash. The slight increase from 2021 to 2022 suggests a potential improvement in liquidity, as the company has a slightly higher proportion of cash relative to its short-term obligations.  \n",
       "21   In 2021, the company's Cash ratio indicates that the available cash is insufficient to cover a substantial portion of its short-term liabilities. This suggests potential difficulties in meeting immediate financial obligations. The company faced liquidity challenges in 2021, as its cash reserves were relatively low in relation to its short-term liabilities. By 2022, the company has made significant improvements in its liquidity position, increasing the Cash ratio and ranging between 0.20 and 0.40. This signals that, in 2022, the company possesses a reasonable amount of cash to cover a significant portion of its short-term liabilities.  \n",
