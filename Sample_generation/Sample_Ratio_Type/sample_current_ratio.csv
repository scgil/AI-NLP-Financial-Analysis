Nonetheless, the company might not be adequately prepared for unexpected events impacting its liquidity. In contrast, in 2022, ratio has decreased and is less than 1, signifying that current liabilities surpass current assets. This suggests a deficiency in liquidity, indicating that the company may struggle to meet its short-term debts."
