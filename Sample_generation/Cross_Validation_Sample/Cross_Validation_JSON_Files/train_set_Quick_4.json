The observed decline in 2022 raises concerns about the company's liquidity. The company's decrease in the Quick ratio from 2021 to 2022 indicates a potential challenge in covering short-term obligations with its most liquid assets, as the ratio value fall below 1.00. It highlights the importance of addressing this decrease to maintain financial resilience and meet short-term liabilities effectively."

The increase to 1.17 in 2022, falling within the 1.00 to 1.50 range, indicates the company now possesses a comfortable buffer of easily convertible assets to cover its immediate financial obligations without relying heavily on the sale of inventory or other less liquid assets. This improvement suggests enhanced liquidity and financial stability for the company in 2022."
