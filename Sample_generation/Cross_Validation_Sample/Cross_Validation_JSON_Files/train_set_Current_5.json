While both ratios fall within the range considered healthy (between 1.50 and 2.00), the decline suggests a slight reduction in short-term liquidity. The 2022 ratio still indicates that the company's current assets are generally sufficient to cover its short-term liabilities, providing a reasonable buffer for unforeseen events. However, management should closely monitor liquidity trends and take proactive measures if the ratio continues to decrease, ensuring the company maintains a robust financial position in the face of potential challenges."
