The increase to 1.17 in 2022, falling within the 1.00 to 1.50 range, indicates the company now possesses a comfortable buffer of easily convertible assets to cover its immediate financial obligations without relying heavily on the sale of inventory or other less liquid assets. This improvement suggests enhanced liquidity and financial stability for the company in 2022."
