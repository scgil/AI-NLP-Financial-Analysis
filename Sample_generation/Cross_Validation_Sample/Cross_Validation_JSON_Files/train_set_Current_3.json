The 2022 ratio still indicates that the company's current assets are generally sufficient to cover its short-term liabilities, providing a reasonable buffer for unforeseen events. However, management should closely monitor liquidity trends and take proactive measures if the ratio continues to decrease, ensuring the company maintains a robust financial position in the face of potential challenges."
