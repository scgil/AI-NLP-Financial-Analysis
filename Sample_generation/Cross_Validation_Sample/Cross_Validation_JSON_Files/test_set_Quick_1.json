This situation persisted in 2022, with the ratio still exceeding 1.50 and having increased from the previous year. This underscores the company's ongoing surplus of easily convertible assets compared to its short-term liabilities, suggesting an opportunity to allocate liquidity resources to other purposes."

The increase to 1.17 in 2022, falling within the 1.00 to 1.50 range, indicates the company now possesses a comfortable buffer of easily convertible assets to cover its immediate financial obligations without relying heavily on the sale of inventory or other less liquid assets. This improvement suggests enhanced liquidity and financial stability for the company in 2022."
