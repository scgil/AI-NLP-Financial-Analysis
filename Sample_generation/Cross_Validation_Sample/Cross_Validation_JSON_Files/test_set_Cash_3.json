This implies that the company may have an excess of cash on hand, surpassing what is required to meet its short-term obligations. In this context, there could be opportunities for the company to deploy the surplus cash more efficiently. However, it is worth noting that the ratio value for 2022 decreased and fell in the range between 0.20 and 0.40, coming into alignment with optimal cash levels."
