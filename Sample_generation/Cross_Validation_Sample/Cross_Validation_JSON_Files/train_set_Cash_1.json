This adjustment reflects a move towards a balanced liquidity position, where the company retains a reasonable amount of cash to cover short-term liabilities, signaling an improved alignment between available resources and immediate financial obligations, and highlighting the efficacy of measures taken to optimize cash management and enhance overall financial resilience."
