The observed decline in 2022 raises concerns about the company's liquidity. The company's decrease in the Quick ratio from 2021 to 2022 indicates a potential challenge in covering short-term obligations with its most liquid assets, as the ratio value fall below 1.00. It highlights the importance of addressing this decrease to maintain financial resilience and meet short-term liabilities effectively."

This improvement suggests enhanced liquidity and financial stability for the company in 2022."
