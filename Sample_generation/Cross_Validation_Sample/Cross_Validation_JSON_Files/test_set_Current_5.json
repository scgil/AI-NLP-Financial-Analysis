This indicates a good level of liquidity and suggests that the company was well-prepared to meet its short-term obligations. Current ratio slightly decreased in 2022 compared to 2021. Although the Current ratio is still within the ideal range, the decrease suggests a slight reduction in the liquidity buffer of the company."

Current ratio increased slightly in 2022, suggesting a slight improvement in the liquidity position of the company. However, the ratio is still just above 1.00, indicating that the company is operating with a relatively thin margin for covering short-term obligations.
