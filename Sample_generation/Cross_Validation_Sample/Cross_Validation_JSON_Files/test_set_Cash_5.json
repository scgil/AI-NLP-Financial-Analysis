This suggests that the organization was likely able to meet its immediate financial obligations without significant challenges but a ratio over 0.40 reveals and excess of cash. The increase in the Cash ratio indicates that the company had even more cash relative to its short-term liabilities in 2022 compared to 2021. While having ample cash is generally positive for liquidity, it is important to consider that excessively high cash ratios might indicate that the company is not effectively utilizing its resources."
