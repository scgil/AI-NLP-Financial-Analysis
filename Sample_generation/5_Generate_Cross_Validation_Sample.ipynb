In this context, there could be opportunities for the company to deploy the surplus cash more efficiently. However, it is worth noting that the ratio value for 2022 decreased and fell in the range between 0.20 and 0.40, coming into alignment with optimal cash levels.   \n",

While both ratios fall within the range considered healthy (between 1.50 and 2.00), the decline suggests a slight reduction in short-term liquidity. The 2022 ratio still indicates that the company's current assets are generally sufficient to cover its short-term liabilities, providing a reasonable buffer for unforeseen events. However, management should closely monitor liquidity trends and take proactive measures if the ratio continues to decrease, ensuring the company maintains a robust financial position in the face of potential challenges.</td>\n",
