       "30   The current ratio of a company is a measure of its ability to pay its short-term obligations as they come due. A current ratio of 1.25 in 2021 indicates that the company has $1.25 of current assets for every $1 of current liabilities. This suggests that the company has a relatively strong ability to pay its short-term obligations.\\n\\nIn 2022, the current ratio has decreased to 1.11, indicating that the company now has $1.11 of current assets for every $1 of current liabilities. This suggests that the company's ability to pay its short-term obligations has decreased slightly.\\n\\nIt is important to note that a current ratio of 1.00 or higher is generally considered to be a healthy sign, indicating that a company has enough current assets to cover its current liabilities. A ratio below 1.00 may indicate that a company is having difficulty paying its short-term obligations.\\n\\nTherefore, based on the current ratio analysis for the years 2021 and 2022, the company's ability to pay its short-term obligations has decreased slightly, but it is still within a healthy range.

A current ratio of 1.51 in 2021 indicates that the company had $1.51 of current assets for every $1 of current liabilities. This places the company in the category of having a current ratio between 1.50 and 2.00, which is generally considered a good ratio.\\n\\nHowever, a current ratio of 1.43 in 2022 indicates that the company had $1.43 of current assets for every $1 of current liabilities.

       "39   The Quick ratio is a liquidity ratio that measures a company's ability to pay its short-term liabilities with its short-term assets. The formula for Quick ratio is:\\n\\nQuick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\\n\\nIn 2021, the Quick ratio was 1.52, which means that the company's current assets (excluding inventory) were sufficient to cover its current liabilities. In 2022, the Quick ratio increased to 2.29, which means that the company's current assets (excluding inventory) were more than enough to cover its current liabilities.\\n\\nTherefore, the Quick ratio analysis for the years 2021 and 2022 indicates that the company's liquidity position has improved, with a higher ratio in 2022 indicating greater ability to pay short-term liabilities.
