In 2022, Current ratio has decreased to 1.54, placing its value in the category defined as between 1.50 and 2.00. What would be the Current ratio analysis for the years 2021 and 2022?","In 2021, the ratio is at ideal values, as the company would be able to meet current liabilities with its current assets and, in addition, short-term assets represent 150% to 200% of the value of short-term liabilities. Thus, the company is also in a position to meet future contingencies. In 2022, the ratio remains at adequate levels. However, its liquidity has seen a slight decrease compared to 2021."," The company's Current ratio decreased from 1.70 in 2021 to 1.54 in 2022, indicating a reduction in its liquidity. Both ratios fall within the range of 1.50 to 2.00, suggesting that the company had a comfortable buffer to cover its short-term obligations but may not be well-prepared to handle unforeseen events affecting its liquidity.",3,0.85412323
1,Apple,Current,"Current ratio of a company is 1.07 in 2021, placing its value in the category defined as between 1.00 and 1.49.

What would be the Current ratio analysis for the years 2021 and 2022?","In 2021 the company would be able to meet current liabilities with its current assets. However, it is desirable that liquid assets exceed short-term liabilities by 50% in order to cope with possible unforeseen events. In 2022 the company reduces the value of the ratio and falls below 1, which means that the company may have difficulty meeting its short-term liabilities."," The company's Current ratio declined from 2021 to 2022, indicating a reduction in liquidity. In 2021, the Current ratio was in the range of 1.00 to 1.49, suggesting that the company's current assets, including cash, accounts receivable and inventory, are generally sufficient to cover its short-term liabilities.

What would be the Current ratio analysis for the years 2021 and 2022?","Current ratio in 2021 is slightly above 1.00. It suggests that current assets are barely sufficient to cover its short-term liabilities. While the company can meet its immediate obligations, there might be a limited buffer for unforeseen events affecting liquidity. This indicates a relatively tight liquidity position. Current ratio increased slightly in 2022, suggesting a slight improvement in the liquidity position of the company. However, the ratio is still just above 1.00, indicating that the company is operating with a relatively thin margin for covering short-term obligations. There may still be a need for careful management of liquidity to handle unexpected events."," The company's Current ratio increased from 1.13 in 2021 to 1.15 in 2022, reflecting a modest improvement in its liquidity. Although the Current ratio remains within the range of 1.00 to 1.49, it suggests that the company may not be well-prepared to address unexpected events impacting liquidity.",3,0.9128134

What would be the Current ratio analysis for the years 2021 and 2022?","Current ratio, ranging between 1.00 and 1.49 for both 2021 and 2022, indicates that company's current assets can cover its short-term debts, but caution is warranted as it may not be well-prepared for unforeseen events.

What would be the Current ratio analysis for the years 2021 and 2022?","While the company's Current ratio was initially optimal in 2021, it decreased to a level below the ideal range of 1.50 to 2.00 in 2022. Despite both ratios still suggesting an ability to cover short-term debts, the 2022 Current ratio value indicates a reduced preparedness to handle unforeseen events affecting liquidity."," In 2021, the company had a comfortable margin to cover its short-term liabilities, with its current assets significantly exceeding its current liabilities. However, in 2022, the company's Current ratio has decreased, indicating a reduction in its ability to cover short-term obligations.

What would be the Current ratio analysis for the years 2021 and 2022?","The company's Current ratio, initially reflecting a perfect balance between current assets and short-term liabilities in 2021, increased significantly in 2022. A Current ratio above 2.00 in 2022 suggests a substantial excess of liquidity, indicating that current assets are more than double of current liabilities.
