    "In notebook 5, samples were generated for training and evaluating the Language Model (LLM) using Cross-Validation. Five folds were created for each type of ratio (Current, Quick, and Cash ratio), resulting in 15 training samples and 15 test samples. The base model was trained independently with each training sample, resulting in 15 trained models. In this notebook, the goal is to evaluate each of the trained models using its respective test sample. Therefore, steps 2, 3, 4 and 5 will be repeated for each trained model and its corresponding test file."
